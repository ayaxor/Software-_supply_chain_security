# 📘 Overview
This repository is part of **Phase 2** of the QuietWire AI Training Program.

The goal of this phase is to develop **clear, structured, and bilingual (English + Arabic)** documentation suitable for **non-technical adult learners**.

This mission focuses on building an accessible explanation of:

### **➡️ What is Software Supply Chain Security?**

Including:
- How vulnerabilities spread through dependencies  
- Risks from third-party code  
- Real-world incidents (e.g., SolarWinds, xz Utils, and Hezbollah supply-chain malware pattern)  
- Best practices and mitigation techniques  

All content in this repository is provided in **two folders**:
- 📁 **English** — Detailed technical explanation in English  
- 📁 **Arabic** — Fully translated Arabic version  

---

# 🎯 Mission 1 — Technical README (Bilingual)
**Topic:** *"What is Software Supply Chain Security?"*

### ✔️ Deliverables:
- `Software_supply_chain_security_EN.md`  
- `Software_supply_chain_security_AR.md`

Each document includes:
- Definition and concept  
- How the software supply chain works  
- Attack vectors  
- Real incident examples  
- Prevention, protection, and recommended controls  

This mission demonstrates the ability to:
- Explain security topics clearly  
- Support multilingual documentation  
- Structure information professionally
